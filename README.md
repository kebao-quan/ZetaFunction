# ZetaFunction


Jakob Bernoulli’s Tractatus de seriebus infinitis was published in 1689. The
treatise was, in its time, the state-of-the art work on infinite series [13]. The seriesP∞
n=1 1/n2 was not computed in the Tractatus. Computing the value of this sum
became known as “the Basel problem.” Leonard Euler (1707–1783) showed thatP∞
n=1 1/n2 = π2/6 in 1734 [17]. He went on to (c. 1736) sum P∞
n=1 1/n2k using
techniques related to those used in the solution to the Basel problem, getting
